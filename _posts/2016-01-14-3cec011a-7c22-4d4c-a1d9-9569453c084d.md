Welcome to the Hummingbird Sanctuary! This website was created to engage readers to stimulate inquiry and spark a wider conversation about some of the most pressing issues of our time - topics that demand our attention as we move into the 21st century - and hopefully, to get us thinking outside the box (hint, there is no box!) to come up with powerful creative solutions. In short: To ENGAGE, INSPIRE, MOTIVATE, and TAKE ACTION!

My three areas of primary interest include: 

1\. **HUMAN HACKING**... or rather, maximizing and unleashing our Human Potential by leveraging powerful and life-changing transformational knowledge and science from the fields of Positive Psychology, Neuroscience, Health Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology, Health and Nutrition, to optimize human well-being and happiness.  Further, to implement and make use of best practices from the Personal Growth and Self-Development movement to help you live successfully and THRIVE! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c0247985-97d1-427b-a66e-7a8cf6a3e7a6.png)

2\. **SPIRITUALITY & PHILOSOPHY**... with a focus on Buddhist teachings and practices, and Eastern spirituality and philosophy in general, along with a smattering of powerful insights from the Christian faith and New-Age thinking traditions. Key concepts and practices explored include core wisdom teachings from all faith-traditions (wisdom that serves and is useful in life!), Mindfulness Meditation (technique and benefits), Yoga, Gratitude & Forgiveness practices, Sound Healing meditations, and other healing, restorative and empowering practices.

3\. **SUSTAINABILITY!**... All things sustainability oriented, including environmental awareness, top eco-friendly products that enhance life enjoyment and satisfaction (while keeping our planet healthier!), and best practices for minimizing one's personal environmental footprint, as well as actions you can take to make a difference!

**_Thank you_** for taking the time to look around and get familiar - and let's continue the conversation and movement!
